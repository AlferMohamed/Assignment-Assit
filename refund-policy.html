                promptly.</p>
            <p>Mis-selection of Product: Refunds are only applicable if the selected assignment has not been provisioned

            <!--  -->
            <h2>Non-Refundable Cases</h2>

            <!--  -->
            <h2>Refund Policy Decision</h2>

                organization's decision will be considered final and binding.</p>

            <!--  -->
            <h2>Changes to Refund Policy</h2>
