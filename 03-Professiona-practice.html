        <h5>Take following in to consideration when developing the “Work Related Learning
            Report” :
        </h5>
        <p>You have been asked to support your training and development executive
            with the planning and implementation of a professional development event
            targeted at a suitable audience to develop their soft skills and/or Information

        <p>Produce a professional schedule (preferably using a project management software)
            that identifies planning and resourcing prior to the event. In addition, design a

        <h4>Sample Answeres</h4>
        <h5>Task 1</h5>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>Im Stephen Smith and working as event coordinator focusing in event planning and delivering specialized in
            IT and Soft skills. The focus of company is to organize plan and deliver IT / Soft skills training sessions
            to target audience to enhance their knowledge and skills.</p>
        <p>The primary goal is to target set of audience and identifying their problems and constraints. An then design
            a plan to deliver IT and soft skill training which they can make a best use out of it. Primarily we do
            identify what are the resources they have and what we have to provide to gaps to successful completion of
            the training.</p>
        <p>Students of grade 9 in VBS academy in Gampola are selected as target audience in this project. The school has
            a computer lab with minimum resources. But the students are not making good use of resource they have and we
            take this as good opportunity to train them on IT and soft skills so that they can use full use out of their
            limited resources.</p>
        <p>There are 5 members (including me) in our team For all the 5 members the responsibilities and works were
            divided. We did not allow any favoritisms among us, and all the team members worked with the full
            cooperation and successfully completed the project.</p>
        <h5>Group Development</h5>
        <h5>Tuckmans stages of group development</h5>
        <p>The forming, storming, norming, performing model of group development was first proposed by Bruce Tuckman in
            1965. The model explains that as the team develops maturity and ability, relationships establish, and
            leadership style changes to more collaborative or shared leadership.</p>
        <h5>Forming</h5>
        <p>The initial forming stage is the process of putting the structure of the team together. Team members then
            look to a group leader for direction and guidance.</p>
        <h5>Storming</h5>
        <p>This stage begins to occur as the process of organizing tasks and processes surface interpersonal conflicts.
            Leadership, power, and structural issues dominate this stage.</p>
        <h5>Norming</h5>
        <p>At this stage team members identifying new ways of doing things as a team. Aa team develops members learn
            structure, talents, politeness, dedication in members and change of leadership or sharing of leadership may
            happen at this stage</p>
