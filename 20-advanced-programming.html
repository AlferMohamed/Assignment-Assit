        <h4>Assignment Brief and Guidance:</h4>

        <p>Family Dental Care (FDC) is a leading up market dental surgery located in Kandy. It provides all types of
            dental treatments to patients which include extractions, nerve fillings, maxillofacial surgeries (i.e.
            surgeries involving jaw bone) and sophisticated dental implants. It is visited by prominent dentists and
            dental consultants with post graduate qualifications, some of whom are working at the Faculty of Dental
            Science at the University of Peradeniya. Patients consult doctors by appointment. On their first visit,
            patients are required to register by entering their personal details such as name, address, national
            identity card number and contact number. A small fee is charged from the patient during registration. A
            separate fee is charged for each treatment given.
        </p>
        <p>Doctors too must get registered at FDC by providing personal details such as name, address, date of birth,
            national ID number and contact number. In addition, consultants must provide the name of their post graduate
            qualification along with the country of the University that granted it and ordinary dentists should indicate
            the number of years of experience</p>
        <p>FDC consists of four fully equipped surgery rooms so that four patients can be accommodated at
            any given time. FDC also contains a dental scan room which can be attended by one patient at a
            time. The dental scan machine is operated by one of the dentists of the FDC facility. Normally, a
            dentist without appointments for a given time slot (say, between 5 PM and 6 PM) is assigned to
            the machine by the manager. When that time slot finishes, another doctor who is free will be
            assigned.</p>
        <p>The staff of FDC is made up of a manager, four nurses (one for each of the four surgery rooms)
            and a receptionist who handles registrations and appointments.
        </p>
        <p>An information system is required to keep track of patients, doctors, appointments, treatments
            given to patients and payments. The system must also maintain information about the staff. It
            has been decided to use an object oriented approach to design and implement the system.</p>

        <h5>Task 1</h5>
        <p>Briefly describe the following Object oriented concepts. Provide diagrams and code snippets to supplement
            your explanations. (LO 1)
            <br>Class
            <br>Object
            <br>Message
            <br>Encapsulation
        </p>

        <h5>Task 2</h5>
        <p>Design a detailed UML class diagram for the Family Dental Care system. Your solution should
            demonstrate all three inter-class relationships, namely Association, Inheritance and
            Aggregation/composition. The classes should include attributes and methods. (LO 2)
        </p>

        <h5>Task 3</h5>
        <p>i. Find one occurrence of inheritance (i.e. generalization) from your class diagram and
            implement it using a suitable object oriented language. Your implementation must cover
            the super class and at least two sub-classes. (LO 1)
        </p>
        <p>ii. Explain the term “Polymorphism”. Demonstrate, with the aid of a code snippet, how
            polymorphism can be achieved via method redefinition from the “inheritance” code that
            you have produced in task 3 - (i). (LO 1)
        </p>
        <p>iii. Find one occurrence of Aggregation/composition in your class diagram and implement
            it using a suitable object-oriented language. Your implementation must cover both the
            “whole” class and component class. Include a main program that demonstrates how
            components can be instantiated and stored in the whole. Provide screen shots (in
            addition to source code) as evidence of program execution. (LO 1)</p>
        <p>iv. At FDC, dentists work at the scan machine in turns. At any given time, a dentist may be
            either treating a patient or operating the dental scanner. In other words, a doctor plays
            two roles at FDC: Treating patients and operating Dental Scanner. If we send a
            getDetails() message to a dentist object, the response varies depending on his/her role at
            the moment. Which object oriented feature would enable this to be realized? Provide a detailed explanation
            and supplement it with appropriate UML diagrams. Provide an
            implementation for the design using a suitable object oriented language. Provide screen
            shots and source code listing as evidence of program execution. (LO 1) (LO 2).</p>

        <h5>Task 4</h5>
        <p>i. What is a “Design pattern” ? How are they documented? How would design patterns be useful to computer
            programmers? (LO 1)
        </p>
        <p>ii. FDC owns a very expensive, state of the art dental scan machine (a device far superior
            to a traditional dental X-ray machine) manufactured by Toshiba, Japan. FDC will be
            owning just one such machine in the foreseeable future. When modeling and
            implementing FDC system in software, you must ensure that only one instance of that
            machine is created. Which design pattern could come to your assistance? Justify your
            answer. Provide a UML diagram and an implementation for the pattern you have
            recommended. You may include suitable attributes for the machine such as serial
            number, make, country of origin and cost. Your implementation should allow the user to
            enter details of the dental scanner and create the sole instance of that machine. Any
            attempt to create more than one instance of the scanner must be prevented. Provide
            screen shots and source code listing as evidence of program execution. (LO 2) (LO 3)
            (LO 4)
        </p>
        <p>iii. The treatments given to patients at FDC can be of two types: elementary and complex.
            An elementary treatment is a single procedure such as a simple extraction or a dental
            filling which usually requires a single visit.
            <br>A complex treatment is a composition of several elementary
            treatments possibly taking several visits by the patient, for example, a tooth implant for a severely
            decayed tooth may require an antibiotic treatment for curing any pus accumulation, an extraction of the
            affected tooth and finally a dental implant of a Titanium tooth. The users of the
            system (mainly consultants and dentists) wish to handle both of these treatments in a
            uniform way. For example, the message getDetails() sent to an elementary treatment
            should provide details of a single procedure while the same message given to a complex
            treatment would list details of each elementary treatment that make up the complex
            treatment.
            <br>Which design pattern is suitable for handling this requirement? Justify your answer.
            Support your answer with a context specific UML class diagram. Implement your
            design by using a suitable object oriented language. Provide screen shots as evidence of
            program execution (in addition to source code listing). (LO 2) (LO 3) (LO 4)
        </p>
        <p>iv. Patients who need dental scans are kept in a First In First Out queue. Assume that you
            have found an already developed Queue container in a software library. It provides
            standard queue operations to insert and remove data (known as enque and deque
            respectively). However, you need some specific operations such as search() to look up a
            particular patient and showAll() to list all the patients in the queue. These additional
            operations are not provided by the library unit. Which design pattern would enable you
            to obtain the additional functionality required by the queue? Justify your answer.
            Supplement your answer with a UML class diagram. Coding is NOT required. (LO 2)
            (LO 4)</p>

        <h4>Sample Answers</h4>

        <h5>Task 1
            <br>Briefly describe the following Object oriented concepts. Provide diagrams and code
            snippets to supplement your explanations. (LO 1)
        </h5>

        <p><b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b>
            <br>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming concept that works on the principle that
            objects are the most important part of your program. It allows users to create the objects that they
            want and then create methods to handle those objects. Manipulating these objects to get results is
            the goal of Object Oriented Programming.
            <br>Object Oriented Programming popularly known as OOP, is used in a modern programming
            language like Java
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Advantages of OOPS</b>
            <br>1. OOP offers easy to understand and a clear modular structure for programs.
            <br>2. Objects created for Object-Oriented Programs can be reused in other programs. Thus it saves
            significant development cost.
            <br>3. Large programs are difficult to write, but if the development and designing team follow OOPS concept
            then they can better design with minimum flaws.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1.1 Class</b>
            A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the
            set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class
            declarations can include these components, in order:
            <br><b>Modifiers:</b>1. A class can be public or has default access (Refer this for details).
            <br><b>Class name:</b> The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).
            <br><b>Super class (If any):</b> The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the
            keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent
            <br><b>Interfaces (If any):</b> nterfaces (if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the
            class, if
            any, proceeded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one
            interface.
            <br><b>Class body:</b> The class body, which contains fields, methods, and constructors.
