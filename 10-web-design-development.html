        <h4>Assignment Brief</h4>
        <p>Borrowing books, returning books or viewing the available books at the Library of the Lowa State University
            is currently done manually.</p>
        <p>Online Library Management System supports to overcome the above-mentioned problems. This system
            would be used by members who may be students or professors of that University to check the availability
            of the books and borrow the books., The librarian can update the member details and the book lending
            details.</p>
        <p>Online Library Management System will include the following information.</p>
        <p>* The librarian, students and the professors can register and login to the system</p>
        <p>* Any of the above users can update their profile details including the password</p>
        <p>* The authorized users can reserve a book for 24hours</p>
        <p>* The authorized users can check book availability</p>
        <p>* The librarian can check the member status and update the lending details (If the book is for the lending)
        </p>
        <p>* The system allows the Librarian to create the books catalog, add/delete books and maintain the books
            catalog.</p>
        <p>* The librarian can update the book return details</p>
        <p>* The librarian can calculate the fine for the late returns if necessary</p>
        <p>* The users can search the books according to the categories (Novels, Frictions, etc.)</p>

        <h4>Sample Answer</h4>
        <h5>Task 1</h5>
        <h5>1.1 Differentiate the communication protocols, server hardware, operating systems and web server software
            with regards to designing, publishing and accessing a website.</h5>
        <p>The computers are just like a human because they too use rules or protocols to communicate.
            Protocols are based on specific rules and regulations for the computing and are designed for
            efficiency. The each rule is defined in different terms and is also assigned a unique name.
            Protocols are specify the standards for communication and provide detailed information on
            processes involved in data transmission. Such a processes include and they are type of task,
            Process nature, Data type and Device management. A single process can be handled by more
            than one protocol simultaneously. This coordination of protocols creates a protocol family and
            also there are many ways computers can communicate with each other, there are many different
            protocols available and some examples of these different protocols include and they are here
            TCP/IP, PPP, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SNMP, RTP and IMAP these protocols are very
            common and popular communication protocol (searchnetworking.techtarget.com, 2018).
        </p>
        <h5>TCP/IP</h5>
        <p>Transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) is the language a computer uses to
            access the internet. It consists of a suite of protocols designed to establish a network of networks
            to provide a host with access to the internet also the TCP/IP is responsible for full-fledged data
            connectivity and transmitting the data end to end by providing other functions including
            addressing and mapping. TCP/IP contains four layers, which differ slightly from the OSI model
            (computernetworkingnotes.com, 2018).</p>

        <h5>PPP</h5>
        <p>Point to point protocol (PPP) that mean a computer network protocol used to transfer the
            datagram between two directly connected (point to point) computers. This protocol is used for a
            very basic level of connectivity providing data linkage between the computers. Point to point
            protocol is widely used for the heavier and faster connections necessary for broadband
            communications (computernetworkingnotes.com, 2018).
        </p>

        <h5>SMTP</h5>
        <p>Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) is the standard protocol for email services on a TCP/IP
            network. The simple mail transfer protocol provides the ability to send and receive email
            messages and however, SMTP is an application layer protocol that enables the transmission and
            delivery of email over the internet (computernetworkingnotes.com, 2018)</p>

        <h5>HTTP</h5>
        <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol it used primarily on the
            World Wide Web. HTTP uses a client server model where the web browser is the client and
            communicates with the webserver that hosts the website. The browser uses HTTP, which is
            carried over TCP/IP to communicate to the server and retrieve web content for the user also
            HTTP is a widely used protocol and has been rapidly adopted over the Internet because of its
            simplicity. Also the HTTP protocol available as HTTPS that mean hypertext transfer protocol
            secure (HTTPS). HTTPS is the only one protocol where encrypted hypertext transfer protocol
            (HTTP) data is transferred over a secure connection. However by using secure connection such
            as transport layer security or secure sockets layer, the privacy and intergrity of data are
            maintained and authentication of websites is also validated so these are the explanation of
            HTTPS (computernetworkingnotes.com, 2018).</p>

        <h5>FTP</h5>
        <p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a client/server protocol it used for transferring files to or
            exchanging files with a host computer. It may be authenticated with the user names and
            passwords. Anonymous FTP allows users to access files, programs and other data from the
            Internet without the need for a user ID or password. The web sites are sometimes designed to
            allow users to use anonymous or guest as a user ID and an email address for a password.
            Publicly available flies are often found in a directory called pub and can be easily FTP to a user's
            computer. FTP is also the Internet standard for moving or transferring files from one computer to
            another using TCP or IP networks (computernetworkingnotes.com, 2018).</p>

        <h5>SNMP</h5>
        <p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a set of protocols for a network
            management and monitoring. These protocols are supported by many typical network devices
            such as routers, hubs, bridges, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and other
            network components and devices. Supported devices are all network attached items that must be
            monitored to detect conditions. These conditions must be addressed for proper, appropriate and
            ongoing network administration. SNMP standards include an application layer protocol, a set of
            data objects and a methodology for storing, manipulating and using data objects in a database
            schema (economictimes.indiatimes.com, 2018).</p>
