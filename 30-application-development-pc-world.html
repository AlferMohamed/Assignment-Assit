        <h4>Assignment Brief and guidance:</h4>

        <p>PC World (PCW) is a medium-sized company that sells over 50 different types of computer products. The
            company has grown steadily in the last 2 years mainly due its popularity over the Internet. They are finding
            it increasingly difficult to cope up with all of the paperwork associated with tracking orders due to the
            increase of number of orders. The Managing Director is frustrated by the problems associated with previous
            traditional 'waterfall' projects. He has decided that PCW will use a company with Agile development
            experience to develop the software for a new order tracking system.
        </p>
        <p>JJLP Software (JJLP) is a software development consultant. JJLP is located on the
            same industrial estate as PCW. JJLP has purpose-built rooms for Facilitated
            Workshops and Agile software development projects. The Managing Director of
            PCW has decided to contract JJLP, on “time and materials” basis, for the
            development of the new order tracking system using an Agile development
            approach.
        </p>
        <p>The new order tracking system will replace the old paper-based system and is likely
            to include some of the following functionalities:
            <br>Receive a sales order via telephone, fax, post or email - carried out by an
            Order Handling Clerk;
            <br>Create an acknowledgement copy of the sales order with a delivery date
            after the order has been confirmed with the warehouse - carried out by a
            Warehouse Operative;
            <br>Create an acknowledgement copy of the sales order stating the item is out
            of stock and the date it will be available after the order has been confirmed
            with the warehouse - carried out by a Warehouse Operative;
            <br>Credit-check new customers and reject them if they are not creditworthy - carried out by an Order
            Handling clerk
            <br>Create a daily report of orders that have been dispatched - carried out by
            the Production Manager;
            <br>Create an invoice for business customers after the delivery - carried out by
            the Chief Accountant (M)
            <br>Accept credit card payment from domestic customers after the order has
            been confirmed with the warehouse - carried out by an Order Handling
            Clerk;
            <br>Create a final demand if a business customer has not paid an invoice after
            30 days - carried out by the Chief Accountant;
        </p>
        <p>
            The new order tracking system should have the following levels of access:
            <br>report only;
            <br>update only;
            <br>update and delete;
            <br>complete system access;
            <br>All acknowledgement copies ofsales orders, invoices and final demands must be printed on the relevant
            company headed forms;
            <br>The new order tracking system should be able to print acknowledgement copies of sales orders, invoices
            and final demands at a rate of 1 in every 5 seconds. However, an upper limit of 10 seconds would be
            acceptable.

        <h4>Sample Answer</h4>
        <h5>Activity 1</h5>

        <h5>1.1. Problem Definition Statement for PC World Company</h5>
        <h5>1.1.1. Problem Definition</h5>
        <p>The problem of the PC World (PCW) is They are finding it increasingly difficult to cope
            up with all of the paperwork associated with tracking orders due to the increase of
            number of orders. but they are medium-sized company that sells over 50 different
            types of computer products. The company has grown steadily in the last 2 years mainly
            due its popularity over the Internet. The Managing Director is frustrated by the problems
            associated with previous traditional 'waterfall' projects. He has decided that PCW will
            use a company with agile development experience to develop the software for a new
            order tracking system. The Problem Statement Analysis Approach to Current system of
            their company we can use 5W's. Answer the 6 basic questions</p>
        <p>
            <br><b>Who?</b> - PC world company has the problem
            <br><b>What?</b> - Due to the increase of number of orders they are decided to change their system with
            using software
            <br><b>When?</b> - When they had a numbers of orders they cannot properly accessing the manual system
            <br><b>Where? </b>-In their order managing system
            <br><b>Why?</b>- This problem occur to increase of the business growth of the PCW
            company therefore they decided to increase the number of orders. Manual
            system did not support them to managing orders. That's why they decided to
            make their system with software
        </p>
        <p>From this problem definition we can identified the requirements and moreover they are
            like to do the software development with the agile method . they do not agree with the
            traditional software methodologies for the current world issues . so we are considering
            their needs and likes for their business growth in making software
        </p>

        <h5>1.1.2. User requirements of PC World (PCW)</h5>
        <p>User requirements, often referred to as user needs, describe what the user does with the
            system, such as what activities that users must be able to perform. User requirements are
            generally documented in a User Requirements Document (URD) using narrative text.
            User requirements are generally signed off by the user and used as the primary input for
            creating system requirements. An important and difficult step of designing a software
            product is determining what the user actually wants it to do. This is because the user is
            often not able to communicate the entirety of their needs and wants, and the information
            they provide may also be incomplete, inaccurate and self-conflicting. The responsibility
            of completely understanding what the customer wants falls on the business analyst. This
            is why user requirements are generally considered separately from system requirements.
            The business analyst carefully analyzes user requirements and carefully constructs and
            documents a set of high quality system requirements ensuring that that the requirements
            meet certain quality characteristics.</p>
