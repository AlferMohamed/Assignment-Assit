        <h4>Assignment Brief and Guidance:</h4>

        <h5>Scenario</h5>
        <p>'XYZ' hotel chain has 100 banquet halls island wide. Any hotel has minimum one banquet hall to maximum 5
            halls. It provides online hotel banquet hall reservation facilities to their customers. The reservation
            system uses a waiting list of the selected banquet halls</p>
        <p>Each banquet hall has unique id, name, location, maximum number guests, reservation date and the three menu
            prices. Customer can search a banquet hall with the location, reservation date and the number of guests.
            According to the hotel chain rules and regulations, when a possible match between reservation and the
            banquet hall is found the customer is contacted via email or SMS and informed. If customer is not responding
            within a day, he or she is placed back in the waiting list and must wait again for another hall.</p>
        <p>If customer requested a date change or a location change or a change in number of guests, he or she is placed
            back in the waiting list and must wait again for another reservation. We will assume that each banquet hall,
            once accepted, will be occupied by a reservation ID. Insert banquet hall details, reservation details and
            customer detailsthrough the keyboard. The reservation process should remove a banquet hall on a given date
            from the queue if the customer “accepts” the reservation. If the customer rejects or changes the reservation
            delete the customer reservation, insert it to the back of the queue and compare next customer reservation
            and
            repeat. This process repeats until all customers complete their reservations.</p>

        <p><b>Task 1:</b>Which data structure can be used, when simulating the above scenario. What are the valid
            operations
            that can be carried out on this data structure?
        </p>

        <p><b>Task 2:</b> Implement the above scenario using the selected data structure and its valid operations for
            the
            design specification given in task 1. Use suitable error handling where appropriate. Test the application
            using suitable test cases and illustrate the system. Provide evidence of the test cases and the test
            results.
        </p>
        <p><b>Task 3:</b> Determine the operations of a memory stack and how it is used to implement function calls
            related to the above scenario.
        </p>

        <p><b>Task 4:</b>Sort the banquet hall list and display from the smallest to largest based on the maximum number
            of seating arrangements that can be done. Sort the banquets halls with two different sorting algorithms and
            compare the performances of those two algorithms.
        </p>

        <p><b>Task 5:</b>There are 8 hotels available in the Southern district in Sri Lanka. A customer plans to visit
            all of these eight hotels through the shortest path within a day. Analyze the operation, using
            illustrations, of two shortest path algorithms,showing how it operates using a sample graph.</p>

        <p><b>Task 6:</b> Banquet hall details are stored from oldest to newest hall. The customer should be able
            to find from the newest to the oldest banquet hall added to the hotel chain.
            Using an imperative definition, specify the abstract data type for the above scenario.
            Examine the advantages of encapsulation and information hiding when using an ADT selected
            for the above scenario.
            Object orientation is a paradigm where a computer program functions by objects calling the
            Methods of other objects, which ultimately produces program behaviour. It makes programming
            simple, readable, and makes programs maintainable. Imperative ADTs are basis for object Orientation. Do you
            agree? Justify your answer.</p>

        <p><b>Task 7:</b>Implement the above scenario using the selected complex ADT. Demonstrate how the implementation
            of an ADT/algorithm solvesthe above problem. Critically evaluate the complexity of an implemented
            ADT/algorithm. Determine the different ways in which the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured,
            illustrating your answer the algorithm which you have developed.
        </p>

        <p><b>Task 8:</b> Asymptotic analysis can be used to assess the effectiveness of an algorithm. How to use
            the Asymptotic analysis for the scenario given in task 7?
            What sort of trade-offs exists when you use a ADT for implementing programs? Describe the
            benefits of using independent data structures for implementing programs.</p>

        <h4>Sample Answer</h4>
        <h5>Task 01</h5>

        <h5>Which data structure can be used, when simulating the above scenario? What are the validoperations that can
            be carried out on this data structure?
        </h5>

        <h5>What is Data Structure and algorithms?</h5>
        <p>Data structures and algorithms are essential components in many computing applications. At
            the point when developers plan and fabricate applications, they need to model the application
            information. What this information comprises of relies upon the reason and setting of the
            application. Be that as it may, it is commonly a prerequisite for any application to embed, alter
            and query a data store. Data structures offer various approaches to store information things,
            while the algorithms give strategies to dealing with this information.[ CITATION sue20 \l
            1033 ]
        </p>

        <h5>Types of Data structures</h5>
        <p>
            <br><b>Array</b>
            <br>An array is an assortment of homogeneous (same sort) information things put away in
            contiguous memory locations. For instance if an array is of type “int”, it can just store number
            components and can't permit the components of different kinds such as double, float, char etc.
            Array is especially valuable when we are managing parcel of factors of a similar kind. For
            instance, lets state I need to store the marks in mathematical subject of 50 candidates. To take
            care of this specific issue, it is possible that I need to make the 50 variables of int type or make
            a variety of int type with the size 50.
            <br>Clearly the subsequent choice is ideal, since monitoring all the 50 distinct factors is a hard task.
            Then again, managing array is straightforward and simple, every one of the 50 vales can be put
            away in a similar cluster at various files (0 to 49).[ CITATION Cha20 \l 1033 ]
        </p>
        <p>
            <br><b>Stack</b>
            <br>A stack is the premise of data structure that can be idea like the linear structure depicting a
            stack or pile, the structure where addition and the deletion of the components happens at the
            highest point of the stack. The primary thought can be clarified by considering your
            information a stack plate or set of cards that you can bring down the top component to
            eliminate things off the stack. This structure is utilized in each part for the programming.

        </p>

        <p>
            <br><b>Trees</b>
            <br>Trees are conceptual data structures, used to oversee information in a progressive way, making
            information recovering considerably more proficient than other data structure techniques. A tree
            is an assortment of hubs that are directly associated and don't have any cyclic relations. These
            hubs contain data and are normally masterminded in a key-esteem structure. The key is an
            identifier for the data, and value is the real information that need to store.[ CITATION stu20 \l
