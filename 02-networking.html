        <h4>About the Network</h4>
        <p>The branch network of EnclaveFilmshas grown without proper planning. The LAN
            cabling in both offices is Cat5e Ethernet. The office complex provides an Ethernet
            link between the two buildings.</p>
        <p>The current networkis a flat network design with minimal redundancy. A small
            wireless LAN is used occasionally by few project managers with laptops and the
            guests at Building B.</p>
        <p>a. Building A - general office and managers, including reception, accounts, and
            administration. It consists of 12 PCs and 02 printers.</p>
        <p>b. Building B - production suites and provides networking for the media development
            and storage. It consists of 09 high-performance workstations, 05 office PCs, and 02
            printers</p>

        <h4>The Management expects to enhance the network based on following major
            criteria:</h4>
        <p>a. Separate the network into VLANs.</p>
        <p>b. Data traffic expected to increase by 80%</p>
        <p>c. Possibly consider connecting directly to the VividZone network; must be a fast and
            reliable connection</p>
        <p>d. High network availability with redundant links and technology</p>
        <p>e. Wireless network access at Building B</p>
        <p>f. QoS to support video applications</p>
