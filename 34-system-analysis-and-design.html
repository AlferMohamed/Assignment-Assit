        <h5>Case study</h5>

        <p>The new automated system is designed to replace the current, manual, error-prone
            process of E-Solutions private Limited. The automation of existing processis to reduce the
            company's expenses and enhance the productivity significantly. This transformation also
            would support for:
            <br>1. Successful teams working
            <br>2. Completing projects on time and within budget due to a better understanding ofsystem requirements and
            tasks to be completed
            <br>3. Starting projects on time through automated project scheduling system
        </p>
        <p>In the proposed system, the Project director creates a project and a “project profile” for
            each project. The creation of the project profile includes identification of project
            employee costs, the assignment of tasks to the project, and the assignment of a project
            manager. The project profile is consisted of project id, project personnel cost, a list of
            tasks assigned, and the project manager. The Project director also creates the teams for
            a given project, assigns employees to the teams, and assigns a team leader. The Project
            manager is responsible for assigning tasks to various teams working on the projects(s).
            The Team Leader assigns tasks to the team members.
            <br>Additional functionality includes:
            <br>Produce and update information about different software projects, project teams,
            specific team member assignments and team skills.
            <br>Perform function point analysisto identify the personnel cost of the project and provide
            information to generate invoices upon completion of project phases.
            <br>Monitor projects and identify completed tasks and ongoing tasks of each project.
        </p>

        <h5>Activity 01</h5>
        <p>Discuss traditional and agile system analysis methodologies used in the industry by
            comparing and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of them. Critically evaluate two
            methodologies by referring to the examples to support your answer</p>

        <h5>Activity 02</h5>
        <p>Produce a feasibility report for the scenario given above and assess the importance of
            feasibility criteria used for the system investigation. Critically evaluate the strengths and
            weaknesses of feasibility study with relevant to the proposed solution.</p>

        <h5>Activity 03</h5>
        <p>Analyse and review the system requirements of the proposed solution given in the
            scenario using a suitable methodology. Functional and non-functional requirements of
            the system should be clearly mentioned. Assessment of the effectiveness and suitability
            of the chosen methodology should be provided with proper justifications.
        </p>

        <h5>Activity 04</h5>
        <p>Produce a system design specification for the above scenario and assessthe effectiveness
            of your design and the methodology used with reference to how it meets the user
            requirements.
            <br>Your system design specification should include architectural design, interface design,
            database design, and program design.
        </p>

        <h4>Sample Answer</h4>
        <h5>Activity 01</h5>

        <h5>1.1 System Development Life Cycle Methodology</h5>

        <h5>1.1.1 Introduction of SDLC Method</h5>
        <p>The System Development Lifecycle or SDLC is essentially a project management model.
            It defines the various stages that are required to move a project from its initial idea or
            concept to implementation and subsequent maintenance. (Preston, n.d.)
        </p>

        <h5>1.1.1.1 Stages of the system development life cycle</h5>
        <p>There are seven main stages in the development life cycle of a modern system. Here's a quick breakdown:
            <br>Planning stage
            <br>Requirements of the analysis or feasibility study stage
            <br>Design and prototype phase
            <br>Software development stage
            <br>Software testing phase
            <br>Implementation and integration
            <br>Operation and maintenance phase
        </p>

        <h5>Planning stage</h5>
        <p>
            <br>The best advice we can give you before we get into the planning phase is to take your time
            and have a good grasp of the application development lifecycle.
            <br>The Planning Stage (also called the Feasibility Study Stage) is exactly what it sounds like,
            the phase where developers will plan the next project.
            <br>This helps you identify the problem and extent of any existing system, as well as define
            goals for your new systems
            <br>They theoretically identify problems before they affect development, designing an effective
            framework for the next development cycle.
            <br>And help them find the finance and resources they need to implement their plans
            <br>Perhaps most importantly, a project schedule is established during the planning phase,
            which can be key if a commercial product is being developed that must be sent to market
            within a specified time frame.
        </p>

        <h5>Analysis Stage</h5>
        <p>The analysis phase involves gathering all the specific parts required for a new system, as well as
            identifying the first ideas for the prototypes.
            <br>Developers can:
            <br>Determine the system requirements for the prototype
            <br>Evaluate alternatives to existing prototypes
            <br>Conduct research and analysis to determine end-user needs.
            <br>Additionally, developers often create a software requirements specification or SRS
            document.
            <br>This includes all the software, hardware, and network requirements for the system they plan
            to build. This will avoid wasting funds or resources when working in the same location
            with other development teams.
