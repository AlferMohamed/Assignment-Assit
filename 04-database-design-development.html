        <h4>Assignment Brief and Guidance:</h4>
        <h4>Case study</h4>
        <p>You are employed as a Database Developer for a large IT development
            company. The company has been approached by a transport company called
            SmartMovers which has grown to a level where need to have an automated
            system to handle day today operational activities to meet customer demands.
            You are given the job to design and develop a database solution for
            SmartMovers to meet their business requirements.</p>
        <p>The company transports chemical products from one location to another on
            behalf of registered customers. Customers are of three types namely
            Catogory1, 2 and 3. Each customer is given a unique customer number and his
            or her details have to be recorded in the system.</p>
        <p>Each transport operation is called a job, which involves picking up one or more
            loads of the products from a customer requested start location and delivers it
            to a customer requested destination. A unique number is given for each job and
            for each load when they are created.
        </p>
        <p>a driver, assistant, and a container (for carrying the product) A container isfixed
            to a trailer so it needs to be coupled to a lorry at the start of a Job. (Single
            container can transport only one chemical product due to safety requirements)
            Paymentsfor a job depends on customer type, product type (No Risk, High risk)
            and the load type (small, medium and large). Transport operations are run from
            9 regional depots. Jobs are allocated to individual depots to service. Depots
            hold, manage and maintain their own transport units which are permanently
            allocated to them to service Jobs. Normally transport units are held at the base
            Depot they belong.</p>
        <p>The final system should be able to provide the required information for
            management decision making and to handle daily operations efficiently and
            effectively.
        </p>

        <h4>Activity 01</h4>
        <h5>Activity 1.1</h5>
        <p>a. Identify the user and system requirements to design a database for the
            above scenario.</p>
        <p>b. Identify entities and attributes of the given scenario and design a
            relational database system using conceptual design (ER Model) by
            including identifiers (primary Key) of entities and cardinalities,
            participations of relationships.</p>
        <p>c. Convert the ER Model into logical database design using relational
            database model including primary keys foreign keys and referential
            Integrities. It should contain at least five interrelated tables.</p>
        <h5>Note:-It is allowed to have your own assumptions and related attributes
            within the scope of the case study given.
        </h5>

        <h5>Activity 1.2</h5>
        <p>a. Explain data normalization with examples. Check whether the provided
            logical design in task 1.1 is normalised. If not, normalize the database by
            removing the anomalies.</p>
        <p>b. Design set of simple interfaces to input and output for the above
            scenario using Wireframe or any interface-designing tool.</p>
        <p>c. Explain the validation mechanisms to validate data in the tables with
            examples.
        </p>

        <h5>Activity 1.3</h5>
        <p>a. Check whether the given design (ERD and Logical design) is representing
            the identified user and system requirementsto access the effectiveness
            of the design</p>

        <h4>Activity 2</h4>
        <h5>Activity 2.1</h5>
        <p>Develop the database system with evidence of user interface, output and data
            validations, and querying across multiple tables.
        </p>
        <p>a. Develop a relational database system according to the ER diagram you
            have created (Use SQL DDL statements).
        </p>
        <p>b. Provide evidence of the use of a suitable IDE to create a simple interface
            to insert, update and delete data in the database
        </p>
        <p>c. Implement the validation methods explained in task 1.2-part c.
        </p>
        <p>d. Display the details payment with the job details and the customer
            details using Join queries</p>

        <h5>Activity 2.2</h5>
        <p>a. Explain the usage of DML with below mentioned queries by giving at
            least one single example per each case from the developed database.</p>
        <p>Select, Update, Delete</p>
        <h5>Note: - The queries you have selected should be meaningful and relevant to
            the given scenario.
        </h5>

        <h5>Activity 2.3</h5>
        <p>a. Explain how security mechanisms have been used and the importance
            of these mechanisms for the security of the database. Implement
            proper security mechanisms (EX: -User groups, access permissions) in
            the developed database</p>

        <h5>Activity 2.4</h5>
        <p>a. Explain the usage of the below SQL statements with the examples from
            the developed database
        </p>

        </p>

        <h4>Activity 3</h4>
        <h5>Activity 3.1</h5>
        <p>a. Provide a suitable test plan to test the system against user and system requirements</p>
        <p>b. Provide relevant test cases for the database you have implemented</p>
        <h5>Note:- Learner needs to give expected results in a tabular format and screenshots of the actual results with
            the conclusion</h5>

        <h5>Activity 3.2</h5>

        <p>a. Get independent feedback on your database solution from the nontechnical users and some developers (use
            surveys, questioners, interviews or any other feedback collecting method) and make recommendations and
            suggestions for improvements in a separate
            conclusion/recomme dations section</p>

            software.</p>

        <h5>Activity 4.2</h5>
        <p>a. Your technical documentation should include some of the UML diagrams (Use case diagram Class diagram,
            etc.), flow charts for the

        <h5>Activity 4.3</h5>
        <p>a. Suggest the future improvements that may be required to ensure the continued effectiveness of the database
            system.</p>

        <h4>Sample Answeres</h4>
        <h4>Activity 01</h4>

        <h5>Identify the user and system requirements to design a database for above scenario.</h5>

        <h5>User requirements</h5>
        <p>User requirements are user needs and describe what the user does with the system. Such as what activities
            users should be able to perform using the system. User requirements are generally used as the primary input
            for creating system requirements. Requirements should see from user's perspective. (Parker, 2014)</p>

        <h5>System requirements</h5>
        <p>Detailed description of what the system should do including the software system's functions, services, and
            operational constraints. The system requirements document (functional specification) should define exactly
            what is to be implemented. (cs.ccsu.edu, c2022) System requirements are either classified as;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Functional requirements</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Non-functional requirements</p>
        <p><b>Functional requirements</b> are services the system should provide, how the system should react to
            particular
            inputs and how the system should behave in particular situations. May state what the system should not do.
            Functional requirements specify what a system should do and what a system should not do.</p>
        <p><b>Non-functional requirements</b> These are basically the quality constraints that the system must satisfy
            according to the project contract. It doesnt include any functional aspects.</p>

        <h5>User requirement for the scenario</h5>
        <p>Smart movers is a transport company and want to promote up and need have an automated system to handle day to
            day activities. The company handles chemical products. The company want to keep records of Customer with
            Customer category, Products with risk type, Load details with load type, Deriver detail and assistant
            details. Lorries and containers details, Payment details.</p>
