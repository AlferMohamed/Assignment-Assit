        <h5>Activity 01</h5>
        <h5>Part 1</h5>

        <p> <br>1.
            <br>a.
            <br>Length of the ream of the cloth is = 20m
            <br>Width of the ream of the cloth = 16m
            <br>Now we can find the area of the ream of the cloth.
            <br>The area of the ream of the cloth is = 20m*16m = 320 m²
            <br><img src="" alt="">
            <br>Now let's find out the minimum number of squared pieces that can be cut from the ream of the cloth
            without wasting any cloth
            <br>For that,
            <br>First, we must find Highest Common Factor of the length and width of the ream of the cloth.
            <br>So, now let's find the H.C.F of 20m and 16m.
            <br><img src="" alt="">
            <br>20,16 H.C.F = 2+2 = 4
            <br>The H.C.F of 20m and 16m is 4m
            <br>Length and width of the square shaped towel is 4m.
            <br>Therefore
            <br>Area of the squared shaped towel is = 4m*4m =16m²
            <br>So, we must divide area of the ream of the cloth by area of the squared shaped towel. Therefore, can get
            the minimum number of squared pieces that can be cut from the ream of the cloth without wasting any cloth.
            <br><b>320m÷16m = 20 </b>
            <br>minimum number of squared pieces that can be cut from the ream of the cloth without wasting any cloth is
            20 pieces.
            <br>b. used ,Highest Common Factor (H.C.F) technique to solve this
            <br>Highest common factor (H.C.F) - highest common factor of two or more positive integers is the greatest
            integer which divides each of them exactly. The great common devisor (G.C.F) also used for the H.C.F.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>2.
            <br>a. Customers that come to a restaurant, On the first day of the month is = 4
            <br>Afterwards, those 4 customers come to the same restaurant once in = 2,4,6 and 8 days respectively.
            <br>divide the integers above by their prime factors. After, let's multiply those prime factors.
            <br><img src="" alt="">
            <br>Now let's multiply these prime factors.
            <br>2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 24
            <br><b>All the four customers come back to the restaurant together is on 24th day of the month.</b>
            <br>b. I solve this using the least common multiplication (L.C.M.) technique.
            <br>Least common multiple (L.C.M) - An integer which is exactly divisible by two or more integers is called
            a
            common multiple of them.
