        <h4>Assignment Brief and Guidance:</h4>

        <p>BAUHINIA is a clothing brand in Sri Lanka, founded in 2018, which has come a long way, offering
            Sri Lankans with great designs of a variety of clothing. Currently, BAUHINIA is handling orders
            through social media networks such as Facebook and Instagram. Customers can message
            BAUHINIA requesting an item/s by sending the item code, size and required quantity. If the item
            is available, the customer is required to send the delivery address, contact number to confirm the
            order. The package with the required item/s will be delivered to the customer's doorstep within
            3 to 5 working days, after which he/she must pay cash on delivery.
            <br>Over the years, BAUHINIA has grown steadily mainly due to its popularity over social media.
            However, they are finding it increasingly difficult to cope up with paperwork associated with
            inventory management due to the increased of number of orders through message requests. The
            Managing Director is frustrated by the problems associated with inventory management and has
            decided that BAUHINIA will consult a Software Development Company to automate the workflow
            of BAUHINIA Clothing.
            <br>AKL Software (AKL) is a software development consultant. AKL has purpose-built rooms for
            Facilitated Workshops and Agile software development projects. The Managing Director of
            BAUHINIA has decided to contract AKL for the development of the new order tracking system
            using an Agile development approach.
            <br>The new online solution will replace the old approach and islikely to include some of the following
            functionality:

            <br> Customer Registration and sign-in : Allow customers to register free. At the time of
            registration, customers need to provide name, email address, delivery address, password
            and two working telephone numbers. Registered customers can sign-in using email
            address and password
            <br> Browse for products: through product catalog, check availability and add products to
            cart.
            <br> Checkout products: Total amount to be paid will be shown. Customer will be redirected
            to confirm billing details: Name, delivery address, email address, two contact numbers.
            Payment method will be cash on delivery.
            <br> Staff registration and sign-in.
            <br> Create a daily report of orders that have been requested - carried out by the Production
            Manager.
            <br> Create a daily report of product availability- carried out by Production Manager.
            <br> Add new items to inventory, update existing item details - carried out by Inventory
            handling Clerk.
            <br> Create a monthly Income report- carried out of chief Accountant.
            <br>The new online solution should have the following levels of access:
            <br> Report only
            <br> Update only
            <br> Update and delete
            <br> Complete system access
        </p>

        <h5>Activity 1</h5>
        <p>1.1 Produce a well-defined Problem definition statement supported by a set of user and System
            requirements for the above scenario. Identify areas (if any) of risk that might affect the
            successful completion of the application.</p>
        <p>1.2 Produce a well-structured Software Design Document that defines a proposed solution for
            BAUHINIA by exploring and analyzing their business problem. Include relevant details on

            <br>Development strategy
        </p>
        <p>Conduct a peer-review and identify opportunities that were not previously considered by interpreting the
            recorded feedback.
        </p>
        <p>3.2 Develop a business application with support documentation, based on the Software Design
            Document produced in activity 1, along with supportive evidence for using the preferred tools,
            techniques and methodologies investigated in activity 2. Assess new ideas or possible
            improvements to the system developed while justifying the reasons for including/not including
            them in the application developed.</p>

        <h5>Activity 4</h5>
        <p>Conduct a critical review for the design, development, and testing stages of the Inventory
            Control application by analyzing the factors that influence its performance against the problem
            definition statement and initial requirements. Conclude the review by reflectively discussing the
            risks identified at the beginning and critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the
            application developed. Identify and justify the opportunities for improvement and further
            development of the application you developed.</p>

        <h4>Sample Answer</h4>

        <h5>Activity 1</h5>

        <h5>Task 01: Produce a Software Design Document by analyzing a business-related
            problem and deduce an appropriate solution including a set of initial
            requirements</h5>

        <h5>1.1.1. Problem Statement and the 5Ws Technique Defined</h5>
        <p>5W1H is the abbreviation summarizing the following six questions: What? Who? Where?
            When? Why? How? This method consists of asking a systematic set of questions to collect
            all the data necessary to draw up a report of the existing situation with the aim of identifying
            the true nature of the problem and describing the context precisely.
            <br>Within a critical and constructive analysis process, it is essential to compile exhaustive quality
            data. Hence the use of open questions requiring supported answers, thereby helping to
            pinpoint, clarify and delineate the problem.
            <br>Better knowledge of all the dimensions of a problem will then make it possible to suggest
            appropriate measures to take the right corrective actions. Sometimes the method is referred
            to as the “five Ws” only, with “How” ignored as it does not fit the pattern, but nonetheless
            used. (humanpurf 2019)

            <b>Implementation and applications of the 5W1H method</b>
            <br>The 5W1H method breaks down into three main stages:
            <br>1. Describe the initial situation;
            <br>2. Determine the key factors and prioritise them;
            <br>3. Propose fitting and, importantly, effective, actions.
            <br>The 5W1H questions are used to establish the situation (phase 1). On the basis of the answers
            and overview obtained, it is possible to find the critical factors (phase 2) and then offer
            solutions (phase 3).
            Keeping it simple, a list of sample questions and explanations follows
        </p>

        <h5>What</h5>
        <p> Explanation: Description of the task, the activity, the problem, the project purpose.
