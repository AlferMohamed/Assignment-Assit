        <p>a. Find the largest number of students he can have in his class so that each student gets equal number of
            pastel sticks and equal number of papers.
            <br>120 = 2*3*5*4
            <br>30 = 2*3*5
            <br>Common factors = 2*3*5

        <p>b. Briefly explain the technique you used to solve (a).
            <br>I choose the method of GCF - Greatest Common Factor. Remember that factors are the numbers I multiply
            together to get another number
            <br>List the factors of each number,
            <br>Look for factors that both lists have in common,
            <br>Pick out the largest factor that both lists have in common and call this the GCF.
            <br>Remember that factors are the numbers we multiply together to get another number Example: 2x 3 x 5= 30
            <br>2 ,3and 5 are factors of 30.
