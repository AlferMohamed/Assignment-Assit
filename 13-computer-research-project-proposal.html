        <h5>Internet of Things</h5>

        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the term which refers to the ever-growing network of physical objects with
            embedded sensors which can connect together via the internet allowing communication to occur between these
            objects and many other Internet-enabled devices and systems.</p>

        <p>
            The IoT is quickly becoming a necessary aspect of people's daily lives. Physical items can now sense and
            collect data which can be controlled through digital and smart technology. The IoT extends internet
            connectivity beyond traditional devices like desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets to a
            diverse range of devices that can utilize embedded technology such as security systems, thermostats, cars,
            electronic appliances, lights, medical equipment etc. These devices, often called "connected" or "smart"
            devices, which can talk to other related devices (machine-to-machine (M2M) communication) and act on the
            information they get from one another. Along with the many benefits, there is also considerable concern over
            the IoT which must be overcome in order to harness the power of this free flow of information.
        </p>

        <h5>Research objective/question</h5>
        <p>Students are allowed to choose their own research topic for this unit. A central skill in selecting a
            research objective is the ability to select a suitable and focused research objective. One of the best ways
            to do this is to put it in the form of a question.
        </p>
        <p>The range of topics to be selected could cover the following:</p>
        <p>1. Underpinning security and privacy issues and resolutions: data mining, data processing (e.g. GDPR),
            encryption (e.g. block chain)</p>
        <p>2. Smart homes, smart buildings, and smart cities etc. and their impact on individuals and society.</p>
        <p>3.The future of IoT e.g. automate manufacturing, medicine and healthcare, virtual world, AI, machine learning
            etc.</p>
        <p>4.The IT infrastructure required to support IoT e.g., 5G, proliferation of sensors, interoperability</p>
        <p>Consider that the development of a methodical and valid research proposal as the foundation for the project.
            Choose a topic of personal interest in a specialism and the topic chosen should allow a sufficient and
            suitable degree of research through the existence of adequate background materials.
        </p>
        <p>The Learner requires to produce a research proposal that clearly defines a research question or hypothesis,
            supported by a literature review (Use the project proposal and ethical consideration form template formats)
        </p>
        <p>1. Define the research problem or question. (This can be stated as a research question, objectives, or
            hypothesis).</p>
        <p>2. Provide a literature review by giving the background and conceptualization of your proposed area of study.
            (This would provide existing knowledge and benchmarks by which your data can be judged).
        </p>
        <p>3. Consider and define the research methodology and research process. Demonstrate understanding of the
            pitfalls and limitations of the methods chosen and ethical issues that might arise.
        </p>
        <p>4. Draw points (1 - 3, above) together into a research proposal for agreement with your tutor.</p>
